*3. About myself:  *
I graduated from Saint-Petersburg university in 2017, but i haven't work in this scope. i've worked as a barman until this time. So, my work experience may seem not be very attractive to get me as a student and employee for your company, but i think i'll be a good one!  
I'd describe myself as a hardworking person with logic thinking. As i have a good background in studying a lot of information in short time, it'll be easy for me during my training.  
I really want to change my job and get into this industry, because it's veery interesting for me and i like coding. I enjoy solving problems, it's stimulating me to grow up.  
*4. Skills.  *
 I've just started training, so, unfortunately, i have only basic knoledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
*5. Examples.*
```

  let x = Object.entries(hash);

  for (let i = 0; i < x.length - 1; i++){
    if (x[i][0] > x[i+1][0]){
      swap = x[i+1];
      x[i+1] = x[i];
      x[i] = swap
    }
